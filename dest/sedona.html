          <h3>Day 1: Downtown Sedona </h3>
          <p>On your first day in town relax, unwind and experience the food, drink, and culture of Sedona! The city of Sedona has something to offer everyone, from foodies to those looking to have their auras cleansed. </p>
           <p>On your way into Sedona on Highway 179 make sure to stop at the Chapel of the Holy Cross. Famous to anyone who has visited the area, the Chapel of the Holy Cross melds the natural landscape and a sense of serenity to create an environment in which visitors can appreciate the natural beauty of the region regardless of their religious views. This stop can be experienced for any length of time the visitor wishes and serves as a wonderful introduction to the city. </p>
           <p>As you move further into Sedona proper it is impossible to miss the entrance to Tlaquepaque Arts & Crafts Village. Located at the intersection of routes 89A and Highway 179, Tlaquepaque Village is home to what feels like an endless number of galleries, shops, and restaurants that emphasize the art and culture of the region. Previous visitors recommend that you set aside several hours to explore all that Tlaquepaque has to offer at a leisurely pace and perhaps stop for a glass of wine or two from one of the many local vineyards.</p>
           <p>It is impossible to visit Sedona and not come across a house of healing that focuses on the application of the healing powers of crystals to calm your body, sharpen your mind, and soothe what ails you. Whether you think it is for fun or fact, a stop at one of these healing centers is a must if you wish to experience an important cultural aspect of Sedona. </p>
        <h3>Day 2: Hike and Play</h3>
        
          <p>Sedona and Oak Creek are full of natural beauty and wonder. There is something for every level of hiker and, with such beautiful surroundings, it is impossible to not be overwhelmed by the natural beauty of the region. </p>
          <p><b>Easy Hike:</b> For those just looking to go out on a strole, take a 10-20 min drive into Oak Creek Canyon and ditch your car in favor of the creek. Easy walking trails crisscross the canyon along the water and there is something new and beautiful around every corner. Many visitors simply pull off to the side of the road to access the creek and, though there are campgrounds and cabins throughout the canyon, you can walk along the babbling creek to your heartâ€™s content. Perhaps pack a nice lunch and a light blanket in your bag to set up on a rock along the way or in one of the many bright clearings. </p>
          <p><b>Medium Hike:</b>  If you are looking for a bit more of an adventure but want to avoid climbing out of the canyon head back out of town for the day and cross Highway 17 to get to the Bell Trail trailhead. This moderate 3.5 mile hike in covers a beautiful section of Wet Beaver Creek and terminates at The Crack. I recommend bringing a bathing suit and your nerve because this area has some fantastic cliff diving for every level of comfort. </p>
          <p><b>Hard Hike:</b> If you are an experienced hiker and willing to sweat make your way over to the Wilson Mountain Trail. Terminating at the highest point in Sedona, the Wilson Mountain Trail is an out-and-back treck that climbs over 2500 feet in 4.5 miles (for a 9 mile round trip). The change in elevation allows you to experience dramatically different environments as you begin in the desert, surrounded by sharp rocks and rough brush, and end in a coniferous forest surrounded by tall pines. Bring plenty of water and snacks for this trip and make sure to take plenty of pictures. We promise that your hard work will be rewarded! </p>
          <p><b>Golfing:</b> If hiking is not quite your thing than rest assured knowing that Sedona is also home to some of the best golf courses in the state. Head over to Seven Canyons Sedona for a game nested in the Coconino National Forest or to Oak Creek Country Club to bounce a golf ball off of the famous Red Rocks of Sedona.</p>
          <p><b>Slide Rock:</b> If the weather is warm than the fun is flowing at Slide Rock State Park. This natural water park is set back into Oak Creek Canyon and is a source of fun for the entire family. Plan on this being a crowded destination due to its popularity with visitors and locals alike but if you are willing to brave the masses than you are sure to have a blast slipping and sliding down the smooth rocks in the cool water. </p>
          <h3>Day 3: Tours</h3>
          <p>Now that you have enjoyed the opportunity to explore the area on your own it is time to gather your tribe and go on a tour! With such a diverse range of things to do around Sedona you know that there is something for everyone so saddle up and get ready to experience Sedona through the eyes of a seasoned professional tour guide.</p>
          <p><b>Pink Jeep Tours:</b> Pink Jeep Tours offer a variety of tours, both on and off-road, to cater to any audience. No matter whether you would like to bounce across the desert floor or take a trip up to Honaki Heritage Site which dates back to 600 AD a conversation with a Pink Jeep Tour representative will help you to find what suits you best. </p>
          <p><b>Wine Tours of Sedona:</b> Sedona sits in the center of wine country AZ so if you would like to experience the diverse and unique tastes of the Sedona Valley Wine Tours of Sedona can cater to your refined palate. Expect to spend the day wandering along the vines, in tasting rooms, and amongst oak barrels.</p>
