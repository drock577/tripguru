          <h3>Day 1: Downtown Breckenridge and Shopping</h3>
          <p>Just a short walk from most lodges or condos in Downtown Breckenridge, it’s full of amazing little shops and hole in the wall places that really represent their culture. You can find anything from Fuzziwig’s Candy Factory to Mountain Wave a local snowboard shop. There is a large variety of restaurants in downtown that are family owned and have amazing food like Duggan’s Deli with their Ruben Sandwich.</p>

</p>
          <h3>Day 2: <i>(Summer)</i> Downtown Breckenridge and Shopping</h3>
           <p>About 20 minutes down the road is Mohawk Trail which is one of the best hikes known because it takes you over 2,000 feet higher in the air. It’s a whopping 8.6 mile hike round trip but is worth every ounce of energy as the view is amazing. You will find lakes at the top year round and maybe even snow in the summer.</p>
           <p>Drive an hour to spend half the day white water rafting will really test your endurance to ever changing conditions, they offer a variety of difficulty levels depending on your group. They provide you with all the necessary gear and will cost between $60-$90 a person but try not fall out as it’s a bumpy ride down the river. </p>
          <h3>Day 2: <i>(Winter)</i> Snowboarding/Skiing</h3>
          <p>Breckenridge is known to have some of the best mountains around with snow pouring in during the winter. Spend a day exploring the beautiful mountains finding new trails on every path will keep the excitement coming. Lift tickets are just around $150 a person but will be the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
          <p>As you can see the ski resort is no joke when it comes to having an enormous amount of trails for all types of riding whether you’re a master or just beginning. You can find anything here from their double black diamond hills to their terrain park where you hit the jumps!</p>
                    <h3>Day 3: Haunted Tour, Gondola Ride, and Animal Spotting</h3>
          <p>Breckenridge is also known for its haunted history as there is a lot of history behind everything aspect of the town. You can take the haunted tour or even just go check out their local gas station which was built on top of a cemetery and has many ghost stories to tell.</p>
          <p> In the heart of the town you can take a free ride up the gondola which would be a great time to break out the camera and get some pictures from above. This will lead you to the base of the mountain where there is tons of activities like zip lining and food awaiting.</p>
          <p>As your walking or take a short car ride up into the mountains surrounding the town you will most likely encounter many different creatures. You can see moose commonly walking around the neighborhoods and mountain goats possibly on your hike. Be careful not to get too close!</p>
